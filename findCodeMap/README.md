# findCodeMap

Files can get pretty messy very quickly. That why I gave every bit of code a id. In this files you can find all code orted and with a commend before it. You can use something like visual code search menu and type in the id and file where you want to look into. This is a discord bot so I sorted every if (arg) statement in a serperate collumn. I also sorted all TODO's and FIXME's.
