# Discord-bot

Hello this is my discord bot. In quarantine I was really bored so I made this. It is a discord bot with a few functions I liked to made. The bot isn't open for public use I only use it for a server with my friends. However, I still wanted to share to code with other people. Maybe someone can learn something from it.

## Commands {#commands}

The program reads message from discord as commands. Here is a list of all the commands with a explanation of how they work.

-   [button.js](commands/button.js)
    : This program is inspired by a game on the hermitcraft server. The goal is to get the highest rank. You get a higher rank be pressing sending `R!button press` in discord if the button is on the rank you want. If you use `R!button look` you can see the rank it's on. It will look like this: ![picture](images/buttonInterface.png) Red is of course the highest rank. To start and restart the button use `R!button start`. Each rank has a color so everyone in chat can see which rank you've got. However, make sure that you set the color off the other roles to standard or prioritize the rank roles over the other roles.
