# Discord-bot

Hello this is my discord bot. In quarantine I was really bored so I made this. It is a discord bot with a few functions I liked to made. The bot isn't open for public use I only use it for a server with my friend. However, I still wanted to share to code with other people. Maybe someone can learn something from it. You can use all the code for your own purpose. (read the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).)

## Commands:

-   button.js
-   duel.js
-   getActiveRooms.js
-   help.js
-   rombotFace.js
-   sayHello.js

## Tools used:

I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as my main code editor. I used [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) module to interact with the Discord API very easily.
